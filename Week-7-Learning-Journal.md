## Content Insights
PHP is a server-side scripting language. As a script, PHP requires minimal user interaction and only runs in response to an event. For example, when the user opens a PHP web page the script is run in the web 
browser before being sent to the user. Compared to a programming language which always runs and utilises more user interaction. PHP does not need to be compiled and is designed to work alongside
HTML which increases its flexibility due to the potential of programming dynamic functionality into the website.

Loading a web page via PHP is a 6 step operational trail. A browser makes a request to the web server. Software such as Apache needs to be present to process the request. Apache will then locate a file to meet that 
request. It will find a file with a PHP extension which as it is processed may require interaction with a database. It will then construct the HTML and send the output back to the browser. 

String concatenation can be used to build strings, which in PHP is very useful for working with MySQL. The use of functions can allow for user authentication checks and form validation. A PHP script even allows for 
mathematical functions to be performed within, a major advantage over HTML.

There are numerous similarities and differences between PHP and other programming languages such as Python. PHP generally follows the same programming logic for features such as variables, functions, operators and loops however 
it differs in syntax. For example PHP uses a $ sign when declaring variables. PHP also includes a foreach loop compared to Pythons standard for loop, which is specifically designed for working with arrays or objects 
without needing to worry about the index.


## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
The identification of similarities between Python and PHP is great when it comes to learning new programming languages. In the IT industry there are numerous different types of programming languages and being able to learn them
quickly is a highly valuable skill. In addition, the PHP language itself is one of the most common web development languages used compared to HTML as it allows for far more complex functionality and websites.
