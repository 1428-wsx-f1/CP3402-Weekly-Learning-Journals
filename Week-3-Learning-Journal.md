## Estimated Hours
This week I spent 4 hours learning for this subject.


## Content Insights
The first focus of this weeks content was an introduction to the CMS tool, WordPress. It is a tool similar in function to Joomla where anyone can create and publish a website for any purpose from blogs to eCommerce sites. 
As of 2025 43.30% of users utilise WordPress as their chosen CMS tool. WordPress features a comprehensive library containing thousands of plugins available to add an additional layer of dynamic functionality to websites.
Since 2022 WordPress has achieved a steady increase in users, demonstrating its continued relevancy in the CMS market. Next, understanding what employers/peers are looking for. The main skills sought after include coachability,
communication, determination, independance, motivation, teamwork and willingness to learn. Typically teams desire a new member who is both a good worker and colleague/friend/person. The skills an employer looks for 
cross over with what team members look for but is more geared towards the work produced and less so the individual.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
This week was more successful with all tasks completed on time compared to previous weeks. Next week I would like to now try and increase the amount of time spent learning from 4 hours to 5 hours as a good starting point.
Overall, I found WordPress to be more easy to learn and design compared to Joomla. I was able to complete my website in roughly half the amount of time and resulted in a better appearance. From this experience I clearly
understand why WordPress holds a large share in the CMS market. The user interface was simpler, easier to change and more built-in tools were available. From this experience I have decided to use WordPress for my first assignment
as I believe I will be able to create a functionally and visually superior website in less time compared to using Joomla. It amazes me that a website that would have taken me a week to construct from skills acquired in Web Design could be completed using WordPress
in a couple of hours. This insight demonstrates the evolution of technology as it  continously evolves to be more efficient and convenient. The outcome of the group interviews also surprised me. Despite not wanting to attend
the practical due to feeling nervous I pushed myself to go, for which I am very glad I did. The questions I had prepared for the interviews were reasonably effective, I decided to change two questions and modified a question to be
more clear and obtained the information I needed. Whilst I know I should have more confident, I should have further prepared by ensuring I was well rested.
