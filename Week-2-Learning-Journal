## Estimated Hours
This week I spent 4 hours learning for this subject.


## Content Insights
The first topic this week was static vs dynamic websites. A static website displays fixed content which needs to be manually updated. Meanwhile a dynamic website can utilise a database to provide a more personalised experience. Static
websites are less complex allowing for faster loading times at the cost of reduced interactivity, making static websites preferable for newsletters, about pages and documentation. Dynamic websites are more complex and load slower
however provide collaboration and functionality like user registration and uploading content for example videos on Youtube. Next, content management systems allows a user to create and publish a website from a central interface. CMS tools 
like Joomla remove the need for website developers as anyone can create a dynamic website with advanced functionality. CMS tools can also utilise themes, categories, templates and plugins for select additional functionality.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
After facing unexpected difficulty launching my Joomla website with the registration I decided to learn how to create a localhost environment for my website. This provided great experience for this process in preperation for future assignments.
Later, I discovered a way to create my website live by signing up directly through cloudaccess.net. From this I have learnt to at least start practicals earlier in order to determine whether any issues will create unpredictable delays.
I have also learnt the value that CMS tools can provide. Overall, I found building my website using the intial template provided to be intuitive and easy to learn. CMS tools help to create appealing, functional and stable websites
free from redundant CSS/HTML code which was a concern I had after completing assignments for my previous Web Design and Development subject.
