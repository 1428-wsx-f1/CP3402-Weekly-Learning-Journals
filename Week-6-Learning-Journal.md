## Content Insights
Project management is the process of organising a project and ensuring it meets all prescribed goals on time. The first step to good project management is to decide on a desired communication method. Following this an environment needs to
be set up where team members can have tasks assigned to them and shared files. It is crucial that all team members are given tasks that are seperated to avoid duplicate work. For example, two team members can not work on the header
section simultaneously. The team must also agree on the performance expected from all members, frequency of communication, number of commits and what period of time constitutes poor contact. Commits to the project should be a single feature or small fixes 
and use imperative voice.

DevOps is a process which integrates the processes between developers and IT operators. This greatly improves collaboration between team members accross different specialties through continous integration and deployment. This allows for faster releases
because it increases stability as team members share work and responsibilities. Continous integration ensures that code changes from many different developers are integrated in a shared repository in order to address issues early, when the 
software is not as complex. Continous deployment allows teams to release code changes sooner after passing automated testing. This automated testing saves time, can be performed more often and verifies the software continues to function as intended.

This content is intended to be applied to a project involving the creation of a WordPress theme. WordPress themes are divided into different files, each holding a different weight in the themes hierarchy. Only 2 files required, the rest 
are optional for additional customisation: the css and index.php files. Going by the wordpress hierarchy index.php is the fallback file. If single pages and blog posts look the same you can use your singular.php to act for both of 
them. When we save a page or post it gets saved within the SQL database, Wordpress queries the database to find which row corrosponds to the page a user is on and pulls that information and displays it in that section. 
If posts exist Wordpress uses a while loop. Both Vagrant and Docker are useful local environment tools for developing a WordPress theme in a consistent environment. For example, docker has a docker-compose.yml file that be used
to quickly define a WordPress environment.


## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
With this group assignment brings the potential for gaining further experience in a collaborative setting. This is an extremely important skill in an industry environment. Therefore, it is important that I ensure that I try to learn
and get the most out of this process as I can. Whilst I am already doing this in another subject, this extra experience will serve as an important reinforcement of learning.
