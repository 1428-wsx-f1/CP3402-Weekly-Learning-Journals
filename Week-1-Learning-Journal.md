## Estimated Hours
This week i spent 3.5 hours learning for this subject.


## Content Insights
The revision of HTML was a good starting point for this subject as the standard language used to create and design website pages. Content is placed between tags to structure and organise information accordingly. 
This content also revived insights from the previous website design subject, for example how to construct an effective call-to-action, draw in users, good website hierarchy and overall effective website designs
that convey necessary information without overly cluttering/overwhelming visitors.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
After watching the lecture recording I wrote down the industry preperations I wanted to achieve from this subject. That being to gain a deep understanding of the processes behind creating and deploying 
profesional grade websites, including front and back-end functionality to provide evidence of my abilities. This in turn will supply me with the skills necessary in terms of website development should a 
job become available and I apply. Unfortunately due to illness though I have fallen behind. Whilst I have taken steps to catch up I feel as though I could have done more, for example reviewed CSS. I understand
that at this point it is up to me what steps I take as I complete this subject. Next time I need to conduct additional research on important topics and practice skills as I enter the most crucial year
of my degree.
