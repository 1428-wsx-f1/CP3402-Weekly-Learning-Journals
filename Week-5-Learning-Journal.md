## Estimated Hours
This week I spent 1.5 hours learning for this subject.


## Content Insights
A child theme derives functionality and style from its parent theme. It is good practice to edit themes by creating a child theme. This is because modifying the parent theme directly can result in work being overriden when the modified
theme is updated. Child themes are loaded after the parent so that the style.css and functions.php files can be overruled by the childs. In the styles file any individual element of the parent theme can have a different style applied.
For example images (img), headers (h1, h2, h3), buttons, text colour (color) etc. 

The first type of theme is known as a block theme, primarily used by non-developers allow users to edit in the Gutenberg editor using text, image, embed, button, header etc. Classic themes are better suited for major projects worked on
by developers as changes are made directly in the code. The use of code allows developers to edit and design the website using the inspect tool, then copy and paste the code to save changes. Using the inspector risks losing progress but
saves time by providing live updates for changes rather than reloading. In addition, if any mistakes are made reloading the tab will reset all changes instantly.

Templates are reusable files used to control the visual design and layout of a website. These pre-designed files include HTML, CSS and PHP to define how content is displayed. These templates are created to suit a consistent design or layout.
For example, blogs, landing page, newsletters, resumes etc. This can drastically speed up development due to the reusability of these templates which can be applied to a website and require only minimal changes. Templates are also built
with responsiveness in mind by automatically adjusting to different screen sizes. The consistency in design makes templates scalable, especially for blog websites.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
This week, the main focus was on the assignment, which reduced time spent learning this weeks content to 1.5 hours. However, additional proficiency in the WordPress and Joomla Content Management Systems (CMS) tools was gained,. Overall,
I have spent many hours learning these tools and an happy with how I created and organised the content to appear in a professional manner. Week 6, will be a great oppurtunity to get my hours spent learning back on track and reach the goal
of 5 hours learning.

I have also learnt that throughout the first five weeks of this, I have only delved into block themes. So far, I do feel as though designing with WordPress in particular has been, somewhat too easy. This is because block themes are designed
for non-developers such as blog posters who typically create small, simple websites as a one person team. Now, I have learnt about classic themes. These are typically used for much larger projects beyond the scope I have been currently 
working within. It is important that I equip myself with knowledge, for example via using LinkedIn learning courses or Youtube.
