## Estimated Hours
This week I spent 3.5 hours learning for this subject.


## Content Insights
A production environment is the location where the CMS website is published, a production server always requires a database present to deliver dynamic functionality and execute scripts. These scripts can be used to
deliver a variety of functionality such as form validation, session management where for example most employee payment views have session timeouts from user inactivity, scripts are also used to display this pay data as well.
Scripts can also be used for updating the contents of a website in real-time, logo makers are a very good example of this. A local development environment is where development of the website takes place either on the
localhost with software such as WAMP or XAMP (including required applications such as Apache, MySQL and PHP) or via a virtual machine.  VM's are typically Linux based due to the operating systems open source nature, developer tools
and performance (Windows has a large amount of "bloat" software and features mainly designed for the everyday person, not developers). Next the staging environment acts as an intermediate hosting option, designed to closely emulate
a production environment. The staging environment is crucial for testing website functionality and client showcases for feedback. There are three development process options: production only, local + production and
local + staging + production. Automating between stages should be monitored and backups created often.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
This weeks activity involved setting up a local development environment for WordPress. Overall I found this activity fairly straightforward and before long had a localhost and connected database. An error was made with the editing of the
website template which caused the same content to load on all pages except the home page, this cost time and was fixed by resetting the "Pages" section of the template. In my local website I installed a simple form plugin to use as my 
registration page, which inserted any details entered as a new row in the associated database. This was a great first experience with dynamic database functionality and has encouraged me to create a proper log in/register page. 
My goal for this week was to increase my hours spent learning from 4 to 5 hours. Unfortunately this goal was not met and even less time was spent learning due to time constraints, especially from other subjects (mainly advanced 
software engineering). However, this is a lesson in understanding that despite setting goals for ourselves we are not always able to achieve them. It is important that we maintain a persistent attitude and try again. On a different 
topic the understanding of Linux's benefits as development environment especially due to Windows unavailing list of features, distractions and interfaces for example copilot, news, paint, OneDrive etc. The emphasis on learning this OS
is also more to consider.
